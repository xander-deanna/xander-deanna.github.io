updated portfolio - homework assignment for 02/020/2021

<hr>

This week's assignment was to update my portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive. I decided to put my own creative spin on the assignment and play around with different colors and attributes while still meeting the requirements of the assignment.
